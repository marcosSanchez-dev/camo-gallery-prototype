# 🎬 Camo Community Gallery – Cinematic Experience


## 📘 About This Prototype

This take-home prototype was built as part of a technical assessment for the Camo team.

The goal was to design and implement a small gallery app where users can:

- Browse before/after comparisons submitted by the community  
- Upload their own comparison with social handles  
- Visually compare images (slider demo)  
- Imagine how this would integrate with Camo Studio and export to social media  

In this README, you'll find my design reasoning, tech stack, user experience ideas, and visual references for a cinematic, community-powered platform.


## 🌟 Goal of This Prototype

This project is a technical assessment for **Camo**, showcasing a premium cinematic gallery experience where users can:

- Upload their own comparisons  
- Experience dramatic visual enhancements  
- Share their creations socially  

The prototype implements all core requirements while delivering a **stunning cinematic UI** inspired by high-end product renders and **8K cinematic aesthetics**.

## 🧠 Comparison Interaction: My Approach

If implemented, I would use a comparison slider component that overlays the "before" and "after" images. Options I considered:

- **Library-based**: use [`react-compare-image`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-compare-image) for a simple vertical slider  
- **Custom canvas-based solution**: to allow blending modes or animated transitions  
- **Touch support**: drag-based on mobile, with a toggle button fallback  

This interaction gives immediate feedback and emotional impact — key for a community product.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

I've created a **cinematic UI experience** that aligns with **Camo's premium brand positioning**:

### 🔹 Visual Language

- 8K cinematic rendering aesthetics  
- Deep gradient backgrounds (purple/teal/blue)  
- Glassmorphism with subtle neon accents  
- Depth of field and rim lighting effects  

### 🔹 Interaction Design

- Micro-animations on all interactive elements  
- Physics-based transitions  
- Contextual hover states  
- Cinematic focus effects  

### 🔹 Technical Implementation

- Canvas-based image processing  
- Dynamic gradient generation  
- Particle effects for depth  
- Responsive design at all breakpoints

## 🔗 Camo Studio Integration Ideas

To connect this community gallery with Camo Studio, I envision:

- A **"Send to Gallery"** export button inside Camo Studio
- Automatic generation of Before/After layouts with branding
- Smart presets recognition: the gallery could display badges like _“Lighting +92%”_ if they match known enhancements
- Users could also **remix** community posts by re-editing the "before" image with different presets
